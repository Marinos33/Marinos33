### Hello World

I'm just a passionate developer who likes to create projects to solve daily life problems and then make my work available to everyone. Long live the open-source.

I like to create all kinds of program: desktop app, mobile app, website, ... 
I'm trying to always do my project in a different way (other techno, different architecture, etc), this way I always learn new things

Feel free to have a look at my public repositories and tell me what you think.
